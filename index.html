        <h1>Our Design Process</h1>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>The products we use every day are derived from the need to solve problems. Designers innovate through deeply considered experimentation and observation of the way people function. As needs are recognized we develop products that make life easier, more comfortable, and more efficient. Designs are developed, broken down, reconstructed, developed, broken down and reconstructed again. We grow this skill of innovating by growing our understanding of process. The development of [insert name of cat boxes] is no stranger to process. Our team recognized many needs by observing the products we used on a daily basis and dissecting how these products weren’t meeting our standards for successful design. We developed a “bug list” of useful products that needed innovating as well as annoyances we experienced that needed design solutions. After discussing possible problems to solve, we decided to consider the applications of cat furniture in small spaces. </p>

      <div class="research">
        <h3 id="research">1) Initial research</h3>
        <div class="">

          <h4>Demographic</h4>
          <p>There are roughly 45.3 million households in the U.S that own cats with an average of 2.2 cats per household and counting. Cats are a common pet for small households and apartments as residences of these types are more common to accept cats as pets for their tenants. These small residences have limited space that has to be used strategically even if pets are not entered into the equation. But if cats are not provided with appropriate spaces for relieving themselves or maintaining their claws, there is greater potential for them to cause damage to their living space. To limit the risk of acquiring pricey damage fees from landlords and ensure the wellness of their pets, cat owners living in small spaces need a solution to providing for the needs of their cats and selves.</p>

          <h4>Researching the market</h4>
          <p>The market for cat furniture is not currently meeting cat owners’ expectations as nearly half of this growing market believes that cat products are underrepresented in pet stores. These products are necessary for providing a healthy and comfortable lifestyle to feline members of the family, but many cat owners feel they must compromise between offering these products to their cats and sustaining their own stylistic and functional needs.</p>

          <h4>Identifying the problem</h4>
          <p>Cat ownership can be a pricey and cumbersome experience that our team considers a solvable problem. We realized the need to find workable solutions for cats and their owners to cohabitate in close quarters without neglecting their individual functional and fashionable needs. Our problem states as follows: “Cat furniture and human furniture demand a lot of space but are equally necessary for cat’s and their owners living in small spaces.”. We needed to innovate a product that accommodated the needs of human and feline tenants that could also provide aesthetically pleasing qualities. It was time to brainstorm.</p>

      <div class="brainstorming">

        <h3 id="brains">2) Brainstorming</h3>

        <p>We’d been studying the methodologies of IDEO Global Design & innovation Company. Before entering their prototyping phase they hold brainstorming sessions. For their team, no ideas are bad ideas, and an unhindered stream of consciousness is encouraged. Their team sits together in a room and ideas are exchanged at random. One member places sticky notes on a whiteboard, organizing them into loose categories as they’re produced. Our  brainstorming took on the same structure (or lack thereof). We blew through sticky notes with chicken-scratched concepts for products that could solve our problem. We came up with solutions that we broke down into three categories: “Couch Concepts”, “Table Concepts”, and “Stand Alones”.</p>

      <div class="idea">

        <h3 id="idea">3) Ideation</h3>

        <p>Our ideas ranged from litterbox solutions to wall-hanging cat jungle gyms. But somewhere in the middle we found three that stuck out. Cat couches designed for human and feline needs, an all-encompassing litter box discreet enough to be placed in a living space, and modular cat cubbies meant that provide storage to cat owners and play for their pets. We developed these concepts more thoroughly and presented them to our class with sketches for visualization. [Sketches below]</p>

      <div class="concept">

        <h3 id="concept">4) Further conceptualization</h3>

        <p>We received feedback from peers and began asking necessary questions for further developing these hypothetical products. What would these products be made from? How might our materials hinder or enhance our products performance for our users? Who are our users and stakeholders and what do they really need? We returned to researching and gathered the following information:</p>

        <div class="archetypes">

          <h4>Customer Archetypes:</h4>

          <h5>The Mindful Guardian</h5>
          <p>With an ever-changing schedule and a lifestyle characterized by its unpredictability, the Mindful Guardian still aim’s for structure and reliability in their family’s day-to-day life. They’re looking for a brand that is able to provide them with the versatility and dependability they're constantly seeking.</p>

          <h5>The Free-Spirited Artist</h5>
          <p>Living life casually without a chip on their shoulder, the Free-Spirited artist has a flexible schedule that fits their easygoing lifestyle and laid-back personality. They’re looking for a brand that’s equally as flexible and carefree as they are.</p>

          <h5>The Introverted Intellectual</h5>
          <p>Unassuming and routinely reserved, the Introverted Intellectual lives a modest lifestyle while in their pursuit of both the thematically and conceptually rich. They’re looking for a brand that can offer them a strong balance of humility and sensibility.</p>

          <h5>The Hard-Working Student</h5>
          <p>Persistently needing to abide by a strict schedule while striving for excellency and new experiences in life, the Hard-Working Student starts their day early, lives diligently, and greets hardship with unwavering determination. They’re looking for a brand that supports their steadfast and tenacious lifestyle.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="materials">

          <h4>Material Research</h4>

          <p>Metrics for success were developed and materials were rated on whether they had these necessary qualities.</p>

          <div class="gallery row p-0">
            <a class="col-lg-4 col-6" data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/materials.jpg" data-caption="Metrics collected and measured in our material research.">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="images/materials.jpg"  alt="#">
            </a>
          </div>

          <h5>Fabrics:</h5>
          <p>We wanted any fabrics we used to be stain-resistant, eco-friendly, fur-repelling, durable, pleasant to the touch, and odor resistant. The fabrics we considered were <em>Moleskin, Nylon, Linen, Microfiber, Canvas, Microsuede, Olefin, Mohair, and Cordura.</em> From this long list, Mohair met the most of our needs from our list of ideal qualities. It was alsorecommended to  us by the owner of Fabric On A Roll, a local fabric supply store. Their owner has many cats and raved about this fabric’s resistance to cat scratches, fur-repelling abilities and tactility. Olefin is commonly used for outdoor furniture and was a close second but is not well-known for its comfortability.</p>

          <h5>Hard Materials:</h5>
          <p>We wanted any hard materials we used to be stain-resistant, eco-friendly, light-weight, durable, pleasing to the touch, and pleasing to the eyes. The hard materials we considered were <em>treated wood, resin, metal, cork, stone and plastic.</em> These materials ranked similarly on the decided metrics but cork was quickly eliminated for its lack of durability and washability.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="behavior">

          <h4>Cat Behavioral Research</h4>

          <p>We watched documentaries, visited pet stores and observed the behavior of our own cats to consider what qualities they may desire from our potential product. Through this research and observation, we concluded cats have a love for perching, hiding in closed spaces, trekking through tunnels and exploring tall structures. They needed places to file their claws, cozy huddles for napping, and heights from which to observe their human roommates. We learned that cats prefer to go through holes no less than six inches in diameter, and sisal is a common material for cat scratching posts.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="select">

          <h4>Selecting a Concept</h4>

          <p>From the knowledge gained in our research and conversations with peers we decided our best course of action for solving our problem was to pursue the idea of innovating modular cat shelves. The other concepts introduced more problems than solutions and would have taken deeper consideration than our parameters for time allowed. This product would be feasible to design in one semester and offered a great solution to integrating cat and human furniture in small spaces. We were excited for the product’s potential and got to work on prototyping the concept.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="proto">

        <h3 id="proto">5) Prototyping</h3>

        <div class="define">

          <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>

          <p> After selecting a concept to move forward with, we needed to clarify what problems we would specifically be trying to solve. We brainstormed and produced a unique problem statement to answer with prototypes. “Both human and cat furniture take up a lot of space as individual units, but lack any sort of junction to work together functionally.”</p>

        </div>

        <div class="sketches">

          <h4>Sketches</h4>

          <p>With a clearer goal in sight, we began sketching solutions individually. We conferred later to compare sketches and new ideas. Numerous questions arose during this process, concerning things such as how these units would be constructed, how they would join with one another, what materials would be practical, and how we would cat-proof areas that users may not want cats to access. We had to keep in mind that these products would need to serve not one, but two users; cats and their owners. This gave us a unique opportunity that also proved to be a challenge.</p>

        <div class="inspire">

          <h4>Inspiration & Research</h4>

          <p>We spent time looking for inspiration from things like Japanese joinery, traditional woodwork, and magnetic unity for our shelf construction. We wanted to pull from any direction that we felt could elevate this product from a standard shelf or cat tree..</p>

        </div>

        <div class="solution">

          <h4>Solution</h4>

          <p>After reviewing various product plans and features, we started to finalize our first prototype design plan; a 12”x12” standard cube-shaped unit composed of interchangeable panel components. This plan provided customization to the consumer without being overly complex. Additionally, the cubic shape allowed users to place square bins into the shelves, and kept the dimensions universal.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="building">

          <h4>Building our Prototypes</h4>

          <p>Upon finalizing our blueprints, we got to work assembling our first prototypes. As for the material, we wanted something light but durable, which led us to foam board. We measured, traced, scored and taped until we finished our first unit. It featured two side panels with circular cutouts, giving a visual of what a consumer might do with our product. We also added a stopper feature on the front of the unit to prevent cats from pulling any storage bins out of the shelves.</p>

        <div class="soft">

          <h4>Soft User Testing</h4>

          <p>Once the first round of prototyping was completed, we decided it was time to introduce our product to the emharshest critics of all; <em>cats</em>. The initial exposure of the prototypes allowed us to roughly gauge how much a cat would interact with a product like ours, and see if any of our proposed solutions would actually perform.</p>

        <div class="feedback">

          <h4>Feedback</h4>

          <p>The exercise with the cats queued us in on a few things; cats like to bite things, and they also like bigger holes to walk through. We used these reactions to make some informed decisions on our plan. We increased the diameter of the cutouts, and gave careful thought to what materials we would be using in the final deliverables. Our next round of prototyping was underway, which meant it was time for some more official user testing.</p>

We used these reactions to make some informed decisions on our plan. We increased the diameter of the cutouts, and gave careful thought to what materials we would be using in the final deliverables. Our next round of prototyping was underway, which meant it was time for some more official user testing.</p>
