          <h1>Our Design Process</h1>
          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p class="#">The products we use every day are derived from the need to solve problems. Designers innovate through deeply considered experimentation and observation of the way people function. As needs are recognized we develop products that make life easier, more comfortable, and more efficient. Designs are developed, broken down, reconstructed, developed, broken down and reconstructed again. We grow this skill of innovating by growing our understanding of process. The development of Meowdular is no stranger to process. Our team recognized many needs by observing the products we used on a daily basis and dissecting how these products weren’t meeting our standards for successful design. We developed a “bug list” of useful products that needed innovating as well as annoyances we experienced that needed design solutions. After discussing possible problems to solve, we decided to consider the applications of cat furniture in small spaces. </p>

          <h3 id="research">1) Initial research</h3>

          <h4>Demographic</h4>
          <p class="#">There are roughly 45.3 million households in the U.S that own cats with an average of 2.2 cats per household and counting. Cats are a common pet for small households and apartments as residences of these types are more common to accept cats as pets for their tenants. These small residences have limited space that has to be used strategically even if pets are not entered into the equation. But if cats are not provided with appropriate spaces for relieving themselves or maintaining their claws, there is greater potential for them to cause damage to their living space. To limit the risk of acquiring pricey damage fees from landlords and ensure the wellness of their pets, cat owners living in small spaces need a solution to providing for the needs of their cats and selves.</p>

          <h4>Researching the market</h4>
          <p class="#">The market for cat furniture is not currently meeting cat owners’ expectations as nearly half of this growing market believes that cat products are underrepresented in pet stores. These products are necessary for providing a healthy and comfortable lifestyle to feline members of the family, but many cat owners feel they must compromise between offering these products to their cats and sustaining their own stylistic and functional needs.</p>

          <h4>Identifying the problem</h4>
          <p class="#">Cat ownership can be a pricey and cumbersome experience that our team considers a solvable problem. We realized the need to find workable solutions for cats and their owners to cohabitate in close quarters without neglecting their individual functional and fashionable needs. Our problem states as follows: “Cat furniture and human furniture demand a lot of space but are equally necessary for cat’s and their owners living in small spaces.”. We needed to innovate a product that accommodated the needs of human and feline tenants that could also provide aesthetically pleasing qualities. It was time to brainstorm.</p>

          <h3 id="brains">2) Brainstorming</h3>

          <p class="">We’d been studying the methodologies of IDEO Global Design & innovation Company. Before entering their prototyping phase they hold brainstorming sessions. For their team, no ideas are bad ideas, and an unhindered stream of consciousness is encouraged. Their team sits together in a room and ideas are exchanged at random. One member places sticky notes on a whiteboard, organizing them into loose categories as they’re produced. Our  brainstorming took on the same structure (or lack thereof). We blew through sticky notes with chicken-scratched concepts for products that could solve our problem. We came up with solutions that we broke down into three categories: “Couch Concepts”, “Table Concepts”, and “Stand Alones”.</p>

          <h3 id="idea">3) Ideation</h3>

          <p class="#">Our ideas ranged from litterbox solutions to wall-hanging cat jungle gyms. But somewhere in the middle we found three that stuck out. Cat couches designed for human and feline needs, an all-encompassing litter box discreet enough to be placed in a living space, and modular cat cubbies meant that provide storage to cat owners and play for their pets. We developed these concepts more thoroughly and presented them to our class with sketches for visualization. [Sketches below]</p>

          <h3 id="concept">4) Further conceptualization</h3>

          <p class="#">We received feedback from peers and began asking necessary questions for further developing these hypothetical products. What would these products be made from? How might our materials hinder or enhance our products performance for our users? Who are our users and stakeholders and what do they really need? We returned to researching and gathered the following information:</p>

          <div class="archetypes">

            <h4>Customer Archetypes:</h4>

            <h5>The Mindful Guardian</h5>
            <p class="#">With an ever-changing schedule and a lifestyle characterized by its unpredictability, the Mindful Guardian still aim’s for structure and reliability in their family’s day-to-day life. They’re looking for a brand that is able to provide them with the versatility and dependability they're constantly seeking.</p>

            <h5>The Free-Spirited Artist</h5>
            <p class="#">Living life casually without a chip on their shoulder, the Free-Spirited artist has a flexible schedule that fits their easygoing lifestyle and laid-back personality. They’re looking for a brand that’s equally as flexible and carefree as they are.</p>

            <h5>The Introverted Intellectual</h5>
            <p class="#">Unassuming and routinely reserved, the Introverted Intellectual lives a modest lifestyle while in their pursuit of both the thematically and conceptually rich. They’re looking for a brand that can offer them a strong balance of humility and sensibility.</p>

            <h5>The Hard-Working Student</h5>
            <p class="#">Persistently needing to abide by a strict schedule while striving for excellency and new experiences in life, the Hard-Working Student starts their day early, lives diligently, and greets hardship with unwavering determination. They’re looking for a brand that supports their steadfast and tenacious lifestyle.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="materials">

            <h4>Material Research</h4>

            <p class="#">Metrics for success were developed and materials were rated on whether they had these necessary qualities.</p>

            <div class="gallery row p-0">
              <a class="col-lg-4 col-6" data-fancybox="material" href="images/materials.jpg" data-caption="Metrics collected and measured in our material research.">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/materials.jpg"  alt="#">
              </a>
            </div>

            <h5>Fabrics:</h5>
            <p class="#">We wanted any fabrics we used to be stain-resistant, eco-friendly, fur-repelling, durable, pleasant to the touch, and odor resistant. The fabrics we considered were <em>Moleskin, Nylon, Linen, Microfiber, Canvas, Microsuede, Olefin, Mohair, and Cordura.</em> From this long list, Mohair met the most of our needs from our list of ideal qualities. It was alsorecommended to  us by the owner of Fabric On A Roll, a local fabric supply store. Their owner has many cats and raved about this fabric’s resistance to cat scratches, fur-repelling abilities and tactility. Olefin is commonly used for outdoor furniture and was a close second but is not well-known for its comfortability.</p>

            <h5>Hard Materials:</h5>
            <p class="#">We wanted any hard materials we used to be stain-resistant, eco-friendly, light-weight, durable, pleasing to the touch, and pleasing to the eyes. The hard materials we considered were <em>treated wood, resin, metal, cork, stone and plastic.</em> These materials ranked similarly on the decided metrics but cork was quickly eliminated for its lack of durability and washability.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="behavior">

            <h4>Cat Behavioral Research</h4>

            <p class="#">We watched documentaries, visited pet stores and observed the behavior of our own cats to consider what qualities they may desire from our potential product. Through this research and observation, we concluded cats have a love for perching, hiding in closed spaces, trekking through tunnels and exploring tall structures. They needed places to file their claws, cozy huddles for napping, and heights from which to observe their human roommates. We learned that cats prefer to go through holes no less than six inches in diameter, and sisal is a common material for cat scratching posts.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="select">

            <h4>Selecting a Concept</h4>

            <p class="#">From the knowledge gained in our research and conversations with peers we decided our best course of action for solving our problem was to pursue the idea of innovating modular cat shelves. The other concepts introduced more problems than solutions and would have taken deeper consideration than our parameters for time allowed. This product would be feasible to design in one semester and offered a great solution to integrating cat and human furniture in small spaces. We were excited for the product’s potential and got to work on prototyping the concept.</p>

          <h3 id="proto">5) Prototyping</h3>

          <div class="define">

            <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>

            <p class="#"> After selecting a concept to move forward with, we needed to clarify what problems we would specifically be trying to solve. We brainstormed and produced a unique problem statement to answer with prototypes. “Both human and cat furniture take up a lot of space as individual units, but lack any sort of junction to work together functionally.”</p>

          </div>

          <div class="sketches">

            <h4>Sketches</h4>

            <p class="#">With a clearer goal in sight, we began sketching solutions individually. We conferred later to compare sketches and new ideas. Numerous questions arose during this process, concerning things such as how these units would be constructed, how they would join with one another, what materials would be practical, and how we would cat-proof areas that users may not want cats to access. We had to keep in mind that these products would need to serve not one, but two users; cats and their owners. This gave us a unique opportunity that also proved to be a challenge.</p>

          <div class="inspire">

            <h4>Inspiration & Research</h4>

            <p class="#">We spent time looking for inspiration from things like Japanese joinery, traditional woodwork, and magnetic unity for our shelf construction. We wanted to pull from any direction that we felt could elevate this product from a standard shelf or cat tree..</p>

            <div class="gallery row p-0">

          <div class="solution">

            <h4>Solution</h4>

            <p class="#">After reviewing various product plans and features, we started to finalize our first prototype design plan; a 12”x12” standard cube-shaped unit composed of interchangeable panel components. This plan provided customization to the consumer without being overly complex. Additionally, the cubic shape allowed users to place square bins into the shelves, and kept the dimensions universal.</p>

          <div class="building">

            <h4>Building our Prototypes</h4>

            <p class="#">Upon finalizing our blueprints, we got to work assembling our first prototypes. As for the material, we wanted something light but durable, which led us to foam board. We measured, traced, scored and taped until we finished our first unit. It featured two side panels with circular cutouts, giving a visual of what a consumer might do with our product. We also added a stopper feature on the front of the unit to prevent cats from pulling any storage bins out of the shelves.</p>

          <div class="soft">

            <h4>Soft User Testing</h4>

            <p class="#">Once the first round of prototyping was completed, we decided it was time to introduce our product to the emharshest critics of all; <em>cats</em>. The initial exposure of the prototypes allowed us to roughly gauge how much a cat would interact with a product like ours, and see if any of our proposed solutions would actually perform.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feedback">

            <h4>Feedback</h4>

            <p class="#">The exercise with the cats queued us in on a few things; cats like to bite things, and they also like bigger holes to walk through. We used these reactions to make some informed decisions on our plan. We increased the diameter of the cutouts, and gave careful thought to what materials we would be using in the final deliverables. Our next round of prototyping was underway, which meant it was time for some more official user testing.</p>

          <div class="plan">

            <h4>Planning Testing</h4>

            <p class="#">We planned to give 3 cardboard units to each of the users to arrange in a way they would like in their home. In order to get an idea of the ideal number of boxes to include for a final product, we gave each user nine small boxes to configure as an arrangement they’d like in their homes using the space they had available. The users needed to keep the boxes for 3 days and then report back for a final interview. All interviews were conducted in person and were guided by a list of questions we would ask about our product experience. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="execute">

            <h4>Execute Testing</h4>

            <p class="#">After giving the boxes to each of the users they reported back for their interviews. The three users were Holly, Gracie, and Dylan. One of the stand out points was that users saw value in including more holes for the box construction. Dylan and Holly were very interested in the tunnel system layout and wanted to try it with more holes.They all mentioned the customization aspect and how that allows for more flexibility in their homes. The intent to make it compact was somewhat difficult to accommodate larger cats so sizing down the box would have to be minimal to maintain structural integrity. However, they did mention that the collapsable storage aspect would make that issue a lot easier to manage. The number of preferred boxes varied. Holly only wanted one.  Her cat was uninterested but enjoyed sleeping in a single unit. Gracies cat showed interest but the cardboard we used to construct the boxes was too weak and the instability kept him from coming back around. Dylan’s cats on the other hand were hissing at him when he would try to take them out. The main issue mentioned overall was that we needed an improved prototype.

            <h4>Feedback and Revisions</h4>

            <p class="#">Based on our feedback the main thing we needed to focus on was creating more stability, getting a stronger material for production and testing a full set of units. With that in mind we constructed the second round of prototypes with foam core which we established earlier on was strong enough to handle the weight of a cat. Caroline constructed a full set of 9 boxes with customizations (scratching areas, catnip balls, and custom holes for the new design to test how much of a difference it would make in their interactions. One set of three boxes was given to Jane. Jane was instructed to keep a daily log over a 5 day period to track her cats activity in relation to the boxes. Days 1 and 2 saw very little interaction, but Jane did note she often doesn’t see her cats most of the day. She noted that the shelves served her well for storage. Day 3 Jane reported that she found litter remnants in the bottom of the boxes so they did seem to be using it some at night. Days 4 and 5 also saw very little interaction even with the incentive of treats.
            </p>

            <p>Caroline did her own test with her two cats to see the difference in the interest based on the additions we had made to the design. In short, they loved it. The carpet seems to be used less than expected; she only saw them scratch it a few times. Having more units made interaction far more frequent. Having closed cubbies they could hide in was a big plus. Adding bedding also peaked their interest. Both cats have used the shelves to sleep in every day since it was introduced. The new hole design was liked a lot better by cat owners and added more personality to the product. Different personality types in cats heavily determined how the cats interacted with the boxes. Caroline’s cats are very active and playful versus Jane’s cats who were shy and reserved.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            <p>After identifying the key issues with Meowdular the continuation of user testing provided a lot of useful information. Cat personalities can be wildly different so it was crucial to account for all needs of cats and owners alike. The solution of jointing boxes together resolved stability issues between boxes. Cat toys increased interaction. Regular rearrangement of boxes increased interaction. Providing a sleeping space helped cats to interact when first introduced to the product. The user testing also indicated that cats would be comfortable and willing to enter a third level if owners chose that for an arrangement. Cardboard showed to be a better material for scratching and would be easy to replace, we also included toy attachment options in addition to the catnip ball options. Bamboo and high quality organic hemp oil. Bamboo was chosen as a lightweight, strong, and sustainable material. Hemp Oil was chosen as a stain to provide cats with a safe environment. This can safely be consumed by cats and helps with digestion. Boxes would be sold as one, three, or six units. Our product would be available online and in pet supply stores.</p>
